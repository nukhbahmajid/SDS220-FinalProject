```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
bechdelSample %>%
  group_by(binary) %>%
  summarize(sample_size = n())
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = bechdelSample,  aes(x = binary)) +
  geom_bar()+labs(x="Passing or Failing the Bechdel Test", title="Count of movies passing or failing the Bechdel test")
```

As binary is a categorical variable, there aren't really any summary statistics that can be found other than the sample size of each group. The saummary statistics table and the data visualization both show that within this sample, more movies fail the Bechdel test than pass, 122 and 78, respectively.
